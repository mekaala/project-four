# **BLATHERING**

## ABOUT
I want to create another database of sorts: something in reference to video games. I think because the game just came out, I want to do something with Animal Crossing.
There are hundreds of collectables in the game: fish, bugs, flowers, fruits, clothes, household items, villagers. There is so much to keep track of whenever players are planning their towns.
So I want to make things easier. I want to make an expansive database that provides players with item values, availability, and identification.
At the minimum, my models will be Fish, Bugs, and Fossils. These are the the three essential collectables that can be donated to the town's museum and can be sold for money. The bugs and fish each have a certain location they can be found from, as well as a period of time when they can be found. The fossils are very different because individual exhibits may require multiple fossils. In addition, the availability of fossils are not limited by the month or time of day. So, there are multiple fields for pieces of fossils, and their respective prices. It is a small step, but hopefully, this website can be a resourceful yet simple database that benefits both longtime fans and newcomers of the Animal Crossing series.

## Programming
I wanted to work more with Django and SQL rather than staying with React and Node as a means of deciding which software I would prefer using during my career. Using Django-React to develop my website has helped me feel more confident about the security of my website, since I am in control of what I can add, update, or delete. Limiting those actions to administration does sacrifice user interactivity, and I realize that Django Admin is best used for companies/products that do not require extensve guest input.
